            "answer": "Europe wants to drastically reduce the number of plastic bags in the battle against plastic soup. In 2010, an estimated 198 plastic bags were used per capita per year. That number must be reduced to 90 in 2019 and to 40 in 2025. EU member states are free to choose their own methods to meet this goal.\nDistributing free plastic bags will be forbidden in the Netherlands beginning on January 1, 2016. In 2002 Ireland introduced a fee of 22 cents per plastic bag in stores, which led to a 90% reduction in their use. Because of this, Ireland is often cited as a shining example of how to address the issue of single-use plastic bags.",
